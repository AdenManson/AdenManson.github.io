        <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

        <p>My name is Aden and Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at the University of Sheffield with a huge passion for game development and video editing. I love the process of creating a game from the design to the development. I also enjoy being able to flex my creative skills and apply the same work ethic to filming and editing videos as passion projects.</p>

        <h2 id="independent-learner">Self Motivated</h2>

        <p>I have always had the self-discipline to finish a project from start to finish and overcome the most difficult parts. I have been developing small games for many years, so have good fundamental knowledge of how I react and handle challenges. My work in game jams over the years has helped me refine this skill of being able to see a project through to the end.</p>

        <h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>

        <p>Taking part in group projects at university has allowed me to buid on the key skillset of working within a team of diverse skills. I am able to contribute using my individual skills to benefit the group as a whole, knowing when to take lead and how to communicate effectvely. My year in industry as a Software Engineer for Tutorful.co.uk has a also greatly helped with this, as I was able to work alongside those more experienced than me and learn how to communicate effectively in a professioal team working on a live product.</p>

        <h2 id="extra-curricular-activities">Extra-curricular Activities</h2>

        <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy flexing my creative skills and editing videos for both personal projects and some client projects. I also enjoy keeping myself active by running, as I am aiming to begin taking on half and full marathons.</p>
