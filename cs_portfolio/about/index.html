        <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

        <p>My name is Aden and I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Sheffield with a huge passion for game development and video editing. I love the process of creating a game from the design to the development. I also enjoy being able to flex my creative skills and apply the same work ethic to filming and editing videos as passion projects.</p>

        <!-- <h2 id="independent-learner">Independent Learner</h2>

        <p>I’ve always been a self-directed learner when it comes to technology. Outside of my degree I’ve been keen to tinker with different programming languages and game engines, picking up tools like Unreal Engine along the way.  I’ve contributed to open-source C++ projects to help gain a robust foundation in the core language of the games industry. My independent approach to learning has enhanced my technical skills and given me a proactive mindset  when it comes to navigating new technologies which I believe will serve me well as a game programmer.</p>

        <h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>

        <p>Participating in game jams has helped me to experience working in interdisciplinary teams including artists, designers, and programmers. I’ve learned to navigate and contribute positively to a variety of team dynamics while crafting playable game prototypes within tight deadlines. This experience has taught me adaptability, open-mindedness and the importance of mutual respect to a collaborative creative process. I would relish the opportunity to work in creative teams with diverse perspectives in order to deliver innovative gaming experiences.</p>

        <h2 id="wellbeing-and-resilience">Wellbeing and Resilience</h2>

        <p>My university journey has enabled me to develop my own strategies for looking after my wellbeing and remaining resilient. I’ve achieved a successful balance in my academic studies through a mindful approach to maintaining mental and physical health. I prioritize self-care through regular exercise and hobbies, and recognize the role of peers and support networks in managing stress. Efficient time management is at the heart of my approach to achieving my goals without compromising personal wellbeing.</p>

        <h2 id="extra-curricular-activities">Extra-curricular Activities</h2>

        <p>Outside of my studies, I love playing 5-a-side football. It’s a great way to stay active and improve my teamwork skills. I’m also a regular at a local board game club, which is a fantastic social activity where I get to relax and enjoy some strategic thinking with friends. These activities provide a healthy balance to my academic pursuits, keeping me refreshed and connected beyond the world of coding.</p>
